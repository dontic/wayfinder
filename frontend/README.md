# # Wayfinder Frontend

## How to start developing

1. Open this directory in VSCode or Cursor

2. Make sure you have the `dev containers` extension installed

3. Hit `F1` -> `Reopen in Container` 

4. Once the devcontainer is open, install the dependencies by running `npm install`

8. Run the frontend -> `npm run dev`

You can then open the url in your browser and log in with the superuser credentials generated in the backend.
